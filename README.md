# DrivingTest
This project is a comprehensive driving test website that streamlines the booking and result management process for drivers . Users can easily book their G2 or G driving tests, check available dates, and select convenient times according to their schedule. Once the test is completed, drivers can log in to view their results. Examiners have the ability to access and manage appointments, update test results, and ensure accuracy in the system. Administrators can view all test results and generate official license numbers for successful candidates, facilitating a smooth transition to the licensing process. With a user-friendly interface, real-time updates, and role-based access, the platform offers a seamless experience for both drivers and administrative personnel.
